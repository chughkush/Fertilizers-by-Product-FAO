## EDA on Indian Fertilizers Use using Plotly Express

**NOTE :**  Dataset and problem statement has been collected by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/josehenriqueroveda/fertilizers-by-product-fao).

I have used Plotly Express to do extensive EDA on this dataset to conclude how India had been using fertilizers from 2002 - 2017.

### Context
It's important to assemble, analyse, monitor and improve the data visualization and exploration, making it easier to understand to apply in real problems solutions. In this data set we have access to the import data (quantity and value), exports and production of fertilizers separated by their main composition, over the years.

### Content
The Fertilizers by Product dataset contains information on product amounts for the Production, Trade, Agriculture Use and Other Uses of chemical and mineral fertilizers products, over the time series 2002-2017. The fertilizer statistics data are validated separately for a set of over thirty individual products. Both straight and compound fertilizers are included.

If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.
